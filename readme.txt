Hello
This was my first program with VisproRexx in the year 1998.
Finaly I decided to made it free.
If you want to use it, you need REXXBASE.DLL from American Coders and
DB2 2.1 (I don't know if can be run with other version of DB2)
I include the source, but I have a crash HD,(hard problem), and I'm not sure that
the source is the same that the final program.

Enjoy.

If you want contact with me:

Saludos
Roberto
